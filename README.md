#project-ti2ni1m

This is the project for using ML to speed up matrix multiplication using ML.

Description: Thepaper “Discovering faster matrix multiplication” (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4.pdf) is a recent method to discover ways of multiplying two matrices faster than the naive $O(N^3)$ for relatively small matrices. It uses reinforced learning.
As part of the project, you will:
1. Explore the mathematics of matrix multiplication and understand the significance of optimising matrix multiplication
2. Test reinforcement learning models inspired by the AlphaZero framework to discover novel matrix multiplication algorithms.
3. Assess the performance of the algorithms identified by the model and explore potential improvements.
4. Explore using matrix multiplication algorithms for self-attention in transformers.
